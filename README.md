# Flavor Pairings Server

This is the GraphQL back-end for creating food flavor affinities.

Although not required, the server runs on Ubuntu 24.04 through [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/ 'Digital Ocean'). The following code is targeted to Ubuntu 24.04 within a Digital Ocean droplet; if using a different operating system or service provider, please adjust accordingly.

## Server Requirements

### Basic Server setup

#### Node.js

The server requires Node.js v22. Follow the instructions below to set up the node environment, being sure to install the correct version of Node.js (22.x):

-   [Install Node.js on Ubuntu:](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#installation-instructions 'Node.js on Ubuntu')
    ```bash
    cd ~
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo -E bash nodesource_setup.sh
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
    ```
-   Verify the installation:
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
-   `cd` into flavor-pairings's main directory and run `npm install`
-   Rename `.env-keys` to `.env`
-   In your `.env` file, update `AUTH_REALM=CHANGE_ME` with the [realm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/WWW-Authenticate#realm) set on HTTP 401 Unauthorized errors.

#### Neo4j

The server requires Neo4j v5.26.1 Enterprise. You can get a Neo4j enterprise license through their [startup program](https://neo4j.com/startup-program/ 'Neo4j Startup Program').

Follow the instructions below to install Neo4j, being sure to install the correct version (5.26.1):

-   [Install Neo4j:](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/debian/ 'Neo4j')
    -   Add OpenJDK's repository:
        ```bash
        sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
        sudo apt update
        ```
    -   Add Neo4j's repository:
        ```bash
        wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/neotechnology.gpg
        echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/neotechnology.gpg] https://debian.neo4j.com stable 5' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
        sudo apt update
        ```
    -   Enable `universe` repository
        ```bash
        sudo add-apt-repository universe
        ```
    -   Install Neo4j Enterprise Edition:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install neo4j-enterprise=1:5.26.1
        ```
        You will be prompted to accept the license agreement. If you obtained a license through the Neo4j Startup Program, select option '3'; otherwise, select '2'.
-   [Set Initial Password:](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/2025.01/configuration/set-initial-password/ 'Neo4j Set Initial Password')
    Before starting neo4j, you need to set an initial password (replacing newPassword with your password):

    ```bash
    cd /bin
    neo4j-admin dbms set-initial-password newPassword
    ```

    -   In your `.env` file, update the key `NEO4J_PWD=CHANGE_ME` to your new password.

-   [Install the APOC Plugin:](https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/current/installation/ 'Install the APOC plugin')
    -   Move or copy the APOC jar file from the `$NEO4J_HOME/labs` directory to the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory:
        ```bash
        sudo cp /var/lib/neo4j/labs/apoc-5.26.1-core.jar /var/lib/neo4j/plugins
        ```
    -   Start Neo4j:
        ```bash
        sudo neo4j start
        ```
-   Enable Neo4j on startup:

    Try:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start neo4j
    sudo systemctl status neo4j
    ```

    If it failed to start, saying that the configuration file validation failed, you may need to change ownership of the folder where the logs are kept:

    ```bash
    sudo chown neo4j:adm -R /var/log/neo4j
    ```

    After changing the folder's owner, try to start the neo4j service and check its status again. If successful, enable neo4j to start on startup:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable neo4j
    ```

    If unsuccessful, make sure `/etc/neo4j` and `/var/lib/neo4j` are owned by `neo4j:adm`.

#### Initialize Server

To initialize the server, `cd` into flavor-pairing's main directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies required for the server.

Then run `npm run init-prod` to initialize the database and create an initial admin user (the initial password will be the same as the entered email and should be immediately changed upon signing in for the first time).

Make sure the client and server ports are properly set in the `.env` file.

Finally, run `npm run start` to start the server.

### NGINX Reverse Proxy

Although not required, the deployment server uses NGINX as a reverse proxy to improve performance and security. Follow the instructions below for basic setup.

-   [Default Install and Configuration of NGINX:](https://www.sitepoint.com/configuring-nginx-ssl-node-js/ 'NGINX with Node.js')

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx
    ```

    -   Create the NGINX server block file and open it with your preferred text editor (in this case nano). Be sure to replace `yourdomain.org` with your registered domain name:
        ```bash
        sudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.org
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.org
        ```
    -   Enter the following and save the file to create a `server` block (replace `3001` with the port number your node app uses if you've changed it; replace `yourdomain.org` with your registered domain name; replace `/var/www` with the directory where you want to host your static files):

        ```text
        upstream node_server{
          server localhost:3001;
        }

        server{
          listen 80;
          server_name yourdomain.org www.yourdomain.org;

          root /var/www;

          location / {
            try_files $uri @node_server;
          }

          location @node_server {
            proxy_pass http://node_server;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
          }
        }
        ```

    -   Make sure there are no syntax errors in your NGINX files
        ```bash
        sudo nginx -t
        ```
    -   Enable your site:
        ```bash
        sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.org /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
        ```
    -   Restart NGINX
        ```bash
        sudo service nginx restart
        ```

### Security

Your deployment server should be secured with SSL. See [Securing NGINX With Let's Encrypt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04 'NGINX Security') if using NGINX.

### PM2 Daemon Process Manager

The deployment server also uses PM2 to manage the node server process. Again, this is not required but recommended to help further manage and keep the server online. To install PM2, simply run `npm install pm2 -g`. To use PM2, `cd` into flavor-pairing's main directory and run `pm2 start dist/index.js`.
